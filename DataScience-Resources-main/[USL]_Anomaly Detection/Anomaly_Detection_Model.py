Anomaly Detection is a machine learning technique used to identify rare or unusual patterns (anomalies) in data that deviate from normal behavior. It is commonly employed in various domains such as fraud detection, network security, and industrial monitoring. Here's a breakdown of how Anomaly Detection works and when to use it:

    >   Unsupervised Learning: Anomaly Detection is often performed using unsupervised learning algorithms, as anomalies are typically rare and may not be explicitly labeled in the training data. Unsupervised techniques such as clustering, density estimation, and isolation forests are commonly used for anomaly detection.

    >   Normal Behavior Modeling: Anomaly Detection models learn the normal behavior of the data from historical observations. During training, the model identifies patterns in the data and constructs a representation of normal behavior. During inference, the model detects instances that deviate significantly from this learned normal behavior.

    >   Thresholding: Anomaly Detection algorithms typically use a thresholding mechanism to classify instances as normal or anomalous. Instances that exceed a certain threshold based on a predefined measure of anomaly (e.g., distance, density, or isolation score) are considered anomalies.

    >   Evaluation: Anomaly Detection models are evaluated based on their ability to accurately detect anomalies while minimizing false positives. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used to assess model performance.

When to use Anomaly Detection:

* Rare Event Detection: Anomaly Detection is suitable for tasks where the occurrence of anomalous events is rare compared to normal events, such as fraud detection in financial transactions or equipment failure prediction in industrial settings.
* Unlabeled Data: Anomaly Detection can be applied to unlabeled datasets where anomalies need to be identified without explicit labels.
* Interpretability: Anomaly Detection models often provide insights into the characteristics of anomalies, helping analysts understand the underlying causes and take appropriate actions.
* Real-Time Monitoring: Anomaly Detection can be deployed in real-time systems to monitor data streams and detect anomalies as they occur, enabling timely intervention and mitigation.

#====== Importing needed libraries:
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

#====== Generate some example data (replace this with your actual data):
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

#====== Or you can use the below to generate with your data:
# X = IDM_df.drop(columns=['target_column'])  # Replace 'target_column' with the name of your target column
# y = IDM_df['target_column']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate the Isolation Forest model for Anomaly Detection
isolation_forest = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, contamination=0.1, random_state=42)

# Train the model
isolation_forest.fit(X_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = isolation_forest.predict(X_test)

# Convert predictions to binary labels (1 for normal, -1 for anomaly)
y_pred_binary = [1 if x == 1 else 0 for x in y_pred]

# Calculate accuracy (as anomalies are the minority class, accuracy is not meaningful here)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred_binary)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)

#================================================================ Notes on Model construction:
'''
Make_classification model:
This is a function provided by scikit-learn that generates a random n-class classification problem.

Parameters:
>   n_samples: It specifies the number of samples to generate. Each sample is a data point.
>   n_features: It specifies the number of features (or dimensions) of each sample. Each feature is a characteristic
    or attribute of the data point.
>   n_classes: It specifies the number of classes (or categories) of the target variable.
    In a binary classification problem, n_classes is typically set to 2.
>   n_clusters_per_class: It specifies the number of clusters per class. 
    This parameter controls the separation of the classes. Higher values lead to more separated clusters.
>   random_state: It controls the random seed for reproducibility. When you set random_state to a specific value,
    the generated data will be the same each time you run the code, which is useful for reproducibility.

IsolationForest parameters:

>   n_estimators: The number of base estimators (decision trees) in the ensemble.
>   contamination: The proportion of outliers in the dataset. It is used to set the threshold for anomaly detection.
>   random_state: Controls the random seed for reproducibility. When you set random_state to a specific value,
    the results will be the same each time you run the code, which is useful for reproducibility.
