* The following outlines the aim of conducting an analysis on this dataset.

</div>

#### UFO Reports

&#x2071; This dataset comprises eyewitness UFO reports collected by the National UFO Research Center (NUFORC). It includes various attributes associated with the reports, making it an intriguing subject for data analytics exploration. I have selected this dataset for three reasons:    

- Data Cleaning techniques:  
> This serves as an illustrative demonstration of effective techniques for tidying up a large dataset, encompassing over 141,000 lines. It also provides insights into troubleshooting issues related to missing data, data challenges, and more  
- Data Analytics:
> I will demonstrate how to extract valuable insights from this dataset and analyze the data to make sense of it, focusing on identifying key areas where UFOs have been spotted. The objective is to discern patterns or insights from the gathered information. Visualizations within this project will play a crucial role in facilitating this analysis
