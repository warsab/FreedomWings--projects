Owner: This dataset was supplied by HyperionDev for Bootcamp project. Collected from an unknown source`  
Shared: With Everyone  

#### &#10148;Project Status: `Completed` [&#10003;]

## Project Scope & Objective:
#### &#10064;Objective: 
> *The purpose of this project would be analysing the data gathered from various car makes and their relationships to one another. The main objective is to explore what features may contribute to their selling prices and to create visualistaions in order to perform a EDA on the dataset.*

#### &#10064;Dataset Type:
* Data Mining and Features.

#### &#10064;Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data cleaning and preperation
* Data Visualizations

#### &#10064;Technologies
* Python
* Pandas 
* Jupyter notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 

## &#10064;Project Description
Data analysis for the project would be based on the various automobile features and their relationships to one another. With the analysis we can conclude what features contribute to the selling price of a vehicle or what factors contribute to their normalized losses.

## &#10064;Project Scope

- Data reading
- Data clean up
- Data preperation
- Data visualisations
