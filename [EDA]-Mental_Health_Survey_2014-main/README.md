#### &#10148;Project Status: `Completed` [&#10003;]

## Project Scope & Objective:
#### &#10064;Objective: 
> *The purpose of this project would be analysing the frequency and attitude towards mental health within the workspace. We can sift through the data taken from the survey and get an understanding of the key features per person/country from a collective model or statistical overview. This can help us analize trends or changes that need to take place in order to better people's experience and attitude towards mental health in the workspace.*

#### &#10064;Dataset Type:
* Survey related. Data gathered from a target audience about mental health in the workplace for research purposes.

#### &#10064;Methods Used
* Inferential Statistics
* Data cleaning and preperation
* Data Visualization

#### &#10064;Technologies
* Python
* Pandas 
* Jupyter notebook
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn 

#### &#10064;Inspiration
> *Inspiration to conduct this project was based on an article based on Mental Health at work from the WHO website.
This led me to dig deeper into the data on mental health and its affects in the workplace

## &#10064;Project Description
A survey was given to people world wide to gather information relating to the frequency and attitude towards mental illness in the workplace. The data gathered was based off cerain questionaires that could be researched in order to measure and draw a deeper understsanding. By the use of visualisations I can get a overview of the data gathered and can therefore begin exploratory data analysis in order to draw conclusions and possible resolutions.
